## Quick Start

This guide helps you plan your project timeline and track important milestones. Use this if you need to:
- Break down your project into phases
- Set key milestones and deadlines
- Track deliverables
- Plan around important dates
- Understand task dependencies

For complex projects with multiple team members, overlapping tasks, or detailed resource management, consider using dedicated project management tools.

## What You Need

### 1. Project Timeline Overview

Big picture timeline:
- Start date
- End date or target completion
- Key phases or stages

### 2. Milestones

Important checkpoints in your project:
- What needs to be completed
- When it needs to be done
- Why it's important

### 3. Deliverables

Specific things you need to produce:
- What needs to be completed
- Deadline for each deliverable
- Who it's for (if applicable)

### 4. Important Dates

Dates that affect your project:
- Deadlines
- Presentations or exhibitions
- Reviews or feedback sessions
- Launch dates

### 5. Dependencies

What needs to happen before other things:
- Task A must be done before Task B
- Deliverable X is needed for Deliverable Y
- Technical setup before creative work begins

## Example

**Project Name:** Interactive Installation Prototype

**Timeline Overview:**
- Start Date: January 15, 2024
- Target End Date: March 30, 2024
- Key Phases: Research & Planning (2 weeks), Development (6 weeks), Testing & Refinement (2 weeks), Final Presentation (1 week)

**Milestones:**
- Milestone Name: Technical Proof of Concept
  - Date: February 15, 2024
  - Why Important: Validates that core technical approach works before investing time in full development
- Milestone Name: Alpha Version Complete
  - Date: March 10, 2024
  - Why Important: Has all core features working, ready for testing and refinement
- Milestone Name: Final Version Ready
  - Date: March 25, 2024
  - Why Important: Complete and polished for presentation

**Deliverables:**
- Deliverable: Technical documentation
  - Deadline: February 20, 2024
  - For: Progress review with advisor
- Deliverable: Working prototype
  - Deadline: March 15, 2024
  - For: Testing session with users
- Deliverable: Final project presentation
  - Deadline: March 30, 2024
  - For: Exhibition and critique

**Important Dates:**
- Event: Mid-project review
  - Date: February 28, 2024
  - Notes: Need to demonstrate progress and technical proof of concept
- Event: User testing session
  - Date: March 18, 2024
  - Notes: Need working prototype with core features complete
- Event: Final exhibition
  - Date: March 30, 2024
  - Notes: Final presentation and critique, all deliverables must be complete

**Dependencies:**
- Task/Item: Hardware setup and calibration
  - Blocks: Development of interactive features (can't test without working hardware)
- Task/Item: Core visual system complete
  - Blocks: User testing (need visuals working before testing interaction)
- Task/Item: User testing feedback collected
  - Blocks: Final refinements (need feedback before making final changes)

## When to Use This Guide

Use this guide if:
- Your project has a straightforward timeline
- You're working solo or with a small team
- You have a small to moderate number of tasks and milestones
- You need a simple way to track progress
- Your project fits within a clear timeline (weeks to months)

If you need:
- Complex resource allocation and team scheduling
- Detailed task breakdown with hourly estimates
- Multiple overlapping projects or dependencies
- Integration with project management software
- Gantt charts or detailed scheduling tools
- Budget tracking alongside timeline

Then consider using dedicated project management tools like Asana, Trello, Monday.com, or Microsoft Project instead.

## Tips

**Start with the end in mind:**
Work backwards from your final deadline to set milestones and phase dates.

**Build in buffer time:**
Things often take longer than expected. Add extra time, especially for testing and refinement phases.

**Prioritize dependencies:**
Identify what must be done first. These are your critical path items that can delay everything if late.

**Set realistic milestones:**
Milestones should be achievable checkpoints, not just wishful thinking. Break large goals into smaller, measurable milestones.

**Account for testing and refinement:**
Many projects need more testing time than expected. Don't schedule testing the day before your deadline.

**Consider external deadlines:**
Exhibitions, presentations, and reviews have fixed dates. Plan your timeline around these, not trying to fit them in at the last minute.

**Review and adjust:**
Timelines are planning tools, not fixed contracts. Review regularly and adjust as you learn more about your project's actual needs.

**Document dependencies clearly:**
If Task B depends on Task A, make that explicit. This helps you prioritize and avoid bottlenecks.

**For immersive media projects specifically:**
- Hardware setup and calibration often takes longer than expected
- Testing in the actual environment is crucial (don't just test on your development machine)
- Build in time for troubleshooting technical issues
- Performance optimization often needs more time than initial development
- User testing and iteration cycles are important for interactive projects
