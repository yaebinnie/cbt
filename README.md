# CBT: Cognitive | Bodies | Traces

### Project Description
Our installation is a multisensory, projection-based experience that explores perception, emotional states, and the interconnectedness of cause and effect. Participants are immersed within a fully enclosed room surrounded by four wall projections, environmental elements, and responsive sound design. Through this environment, the installation encourages reflection on how personal perception shapes one’s reality.
