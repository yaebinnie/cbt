# CBT: Cognitive | Bodies | Traces

### Project Description
Our installation is a multisensory, projection-based experience that explores perception, emotional states, and the interconnectedness of cause and effect. Participants are immersed within a fully enclosed room surrounded by four wall projections, environmental elements, and responsive sound design. Through this environment, the installation encourages reflection on how personal perception shapes one’s reality.

### Group Roles

### **Visual Programmer & Interactive Technician - Gnana**

**Supporting Member(s): Olivia, Leyla**

**Description:** Develops real-time visuals and interactive systems using node-based and game engine tools. Translates conceptual ideas into motion through data-driven visuals, integrating sensor input and audience interaction for dynamic responsiveness. Maintains technical reliability across installations.

**Software Used:**

- TouchDesigner, Unity
- Arduino / Sensor Interfaces
- Adobe After Effects

**Skills & Responsibilities:**

- Generative visual programming and compositing
- Real-time interaction mapping
- System testing and debugging
- Sensor calibration and hardware integration
- Optimization for exhibition performance

### **Installation & UI/UX Designer - Leyla**

**Supporting Member(s): Lilli**

**Description:** Designs the spatial setup and user experience, bridging digital interactivity with physical environment. Oversees projection mapping, interface flow, and participant experience design to create intuitive and immersive engagement within the installation.

**Software Used:**

- MadMapper, Blender, OBS Studio
- Figma, Unity UI
- Adobe XD, Photoshop

**Skills & Responsibilities:**

- Projection mapping and spatial layout design
- User interface and experience flow
- Environment setup and testing
- Accessibility and interaction usability
- Coordination of visual and physical cohesion

### **Art Implementation**

Please specify responsibilities according to your installation components. You should relate to modeling\ rigging, and animation as separate tasks, and specify who does what. The same goes for live footage shooting, which requires a photographer and an editor. All the roles involved in the making of your Installation’s core material should be broken down to their creation process stages, and specified.

All files will be shared via Google Drive and GitHub 

- Video Compositing
    - Visual programmer and Sound Designer should work together on putting together the video feeds.
- Technical Implementation
    - Arduino components and 3D custom parts should be made
    - Testing of hardware and software integration with the video footage.
- TouchDesign Progress
    - Arduino team will need to connect their work to TouchDesigner for input.
    - The footage will then be implemented into TouchDesigner.
    - Final rendering, effects, and interactivity will be made in TouchDesigner.
- Final steps
    - All members will work together for putting all final hardware, software, and props in a space.
    - Work together during install and deinstall to consult necessary changes.

### **Direction of Prototyping and Testing**

This responsibility may change and shift according to the prototype’s nature: Naturally, tech and core design prototypes should be managed by the programmers, while art or other playtests could be directed by the art and concept team members.

- Concept Art and Test Footage
    - Creative teams should work and update the team on WIP footage and concepts.
    - 2D drawings and sketches should be proposed for selecting visual ideas and setups.
- Technical Prototyping
    - Arduino team should test if inputs are successful in TouchDesigner.
    - This should be the foundation for figuring out the forms of interaction and control.
- Playtesting
    - Bring in outside participants and get their feedback on our developing experiences
