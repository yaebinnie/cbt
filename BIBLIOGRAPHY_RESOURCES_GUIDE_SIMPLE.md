## Quick Start

This guide helps you document references, resources, and inspiration for your project. Use this if you need to:
- Track where your ideas came from
- Keep a list of helpful resources
- Document similar projects for reference
- Organize technical documentation links
- Build a simple bibliography

For academic research projects or complex documentation needs, use more formal bibliography tools or citation management software.

## When to Use This Guide

Use this guide if:
- You need to track a small to moderate number of references
- Your project is a prototype or simple project
- You want a quick way to organize resources
- You don't need formal academic citations
- You're documenting inspiration and technical resources together

If you need:
- Formal academic citations with specific style requirements
- Extensive bibliography management
- Citation formatting (APA, MLA, Chicago, etc.)
- Integration with citation management software (Zotero, Mendeley, etc.)
- Large-scale research documentation

Then consider using dedicated bibliography tools or citation management software instead.
